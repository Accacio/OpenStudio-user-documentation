<p>After completing the <a href="../../getting_started/GettingStarted/#introductory-tutorial">Introductory Tutorial</a>, you can find additional information on using OpenStudio by topic below.</p>
<h2 id="envelope">Envelope</h2>
<p>The building envelope is created using the SketchUp OpenStudio Plug-in. Refer to <a href="../sketchup_plugin_interface/">the SketchUp Plug-in Interface Section</a> to learn more about the interface and toolbars for the plug-in.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="choosing-a-template">Choosing a template</h3>
<p>The New OpenStudio Model From Template (<img alt="New OpenStudio Model" src="../../img/plugin_reference_guide/os_new.png" title="New OpenStudio Model" />) tool is represented by this icon in the toolbar. Templates contain data for constructions, loads, and schedules for four vintages across all U.S. climate zones. Templates do not contain any geometry.</p>

<h3 id="creating-and-customizing-the-envelope">Creating and Customizing the Envelope</h3>
<p>Drawing a floor plan in SketchUp and extruding up from floor plan using the "The Space Diagram" tool(<img alt="New OpenStudio Model" src="../../img/plugin_reference_guide/extrude.png" title="New OpenStudio Model" />) is one way to create your envelope. The video below demonstrates this workflow. </p>
<p>Creating geometry from photographs is another option. To learn more about it watch the <a href="http://youtu.be/6IPZIrpl5vs?list=PL8CC6E4D9908F17BF">photo matching tutorial playlist on YouTube.</a> </p>
<p><iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wzzY_W2WELo?rel=0&start=44&end=129&autoplay=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><em>Above: This video shows you how to create your building envelope. It uses the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in.</em></p>
<p>After defining the building envelope, you use the Surface Matching tool to set the boundary conditions. These will allow thermal connections between spaces and will inform OpenStudio about what construction to apply.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fenestration">Fenestration</h3>
<p>There are many ways to add windows to your building envelope.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the "Project Loose Geometry" tool for adding window.
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/wzzY_W2WELo?rel=0&start=129&end=171&autoplay=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Above: This video shows how to create windows using the "Project Loose Geometry" tool".</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Set a window to wall ratio, for the whole building or for space type, by selecting all or just a space and going to "Plugins/OpenStudio User Scripts/Add or Alter Model Elements/Set Window to Wall Ratio" and edit or use defaults. This script will remove all existing windows.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="defining-conditions-for-heat-transfer-through-surfaces">Defining Conditions for Heat Transfer Through Surfaces</h3>
<ul>
<li>Choose the "Render by Boundary Condition" (<img alt="Render by Boundary" src="../../img/plugin_reference_guide/render_boundry.png" title="Render Boundary Condition" />) setting.</li>
<li>Check your model to make sure the boundary settings are correct. Blue indicates exterior surfaces, green indicate interior walls, and brown indicates floors. You can use the SketchUp "Section Plane" tool to view a cross section of the model and see interior surfaces.</li>
<li>If you have green surfaces on the outside of the mode, use the Surface Matching (<img alt="Surface Matching" src="../../img/plugin_reference_guide/SurfaceMatchingSelected-24.png" title="Surface Matching Tool" />) tool to open up the dialog and hit "Intersect the Entire Model." This will not work if you are inside a single space when you run it. </li>
<li>Then select "Match the Entire Model" to correct the model. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="schedules">Schedules</h2>
<h3 id="year-settings">Year Settings</h3>
<p>The Year Settings subtab lets you set the day of the week the simulation should start. Define using Calendar Year or First Day Of Year buttons and pull-downs.</p>
<p>The tab can also be used to configure and turn Daylight Savings Time on and off.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="inspecting-and-adjusting-schedule-sets">Inspecting and Adjusting Schedule Sets</h3>
<p>A Schedule Set is a collection of schedules for building activities or elements.</p>
<p>A schedule set can be applied to an entire building, a story, a space type, or an individual space.</p>
<p>This sub-tab has two kinds of drop zones. You can drop schedule sets from My Model or Library into the bottom of the left pane, or you can drop individual schedules into the drop zones in the main body.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="inspecting-and-editing-ruleset-schedules">Inspecting and Editing Ruleset Schedules</h3>
<p>This tab is a visual editor for Ruleset Schedules. As the name implies, a schedule consists of a series of rules. Each rule or profile can be applied for a specific date range and for specific days of the week.</p>
<p>If two rules appear on the same day, the one with a higher priority is used. You can use the rule colors to visually scan the entire year in the calendar on the right of the body to see what rule is applied for a specific day.</p>
<p>A new profile starts as a flat line. Double click to split the profile and then drag one segment up or down. Vertical sections can also be dragged left or right. Click Set Limits to change the vertical limits of your profile. To type precise values for a profile, mouse over the profile and enter a value with your keyboard.</p>
<p>Although you can use 
Compact and other schedule types in your model, you can visualize and edit only Ruleset Schedules in the OpenStudio application.</p>
<p>The lower profile view is a navigation for when you are zoomed to 15-minute or 1-minute time steps.</p>

<h2 id="constructions">Constructions</h2>
<p>In an energy model, each surface must have a construction assigned. The construction determines the heat transfer through that surface. A construction set can be applied to an entire building, a story, a space type, or an individual space. Usually a majority of the exterior walls in a building will share the same construction. You can assign the exterior wall construction on the building level and that construction will be applied to all exterior walls. This will be the default construction, but you can still edit surfaces and subsurfaces that differ from the defaults. </p>
<h3 id="construction-sets">Construction Sets</h3>
<p>A Construction Set object is structured very much like the Schedule Set. It can contain constructions for different surface types and boundary conditions.</p>
<p>Construction sets do not have to be complete sets. For example, you can have a construction set assigned to a story that has only an exterior wall. For the rest of the surface types, constructions will be inherited from the building object.</p>
<p><img alt="Construction Set" src="../../img/create_model/construct_set.png" title="Construction Set" /> </p>
<p><em>Above: This screenshot shows an example of a construction set added from the library.</em></p>

<p><em>Above: This video shows you how to obtain construction and material objects from the Building Component Library and load them into your current model.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="constructions_1">Constructions</h3>
<p>The Constructions sub-tab lists construction objects that are in your model. You can drag additional constructions here from the library. Constructions download using the Online BCL window will appear in the library with a “BCL” flag.</p>
<p>A construction consists of one or more material layers. You can add materials by dragging them from My Model or the Library to the drop zone. You can only add new materials to the bottom which represents the inside of the wall. You can delete any material by clicking the “x” next to the name.</p>
<p><img alt="Constructions" src="../../img/create_model/constructions.png" title="Constructions" /> </p>
<p><em>Above: Edit and create constructions on this tab.</em></p>
<hr />
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<p>Constructions are made of one or more layers of materials. The 
Materials subtab lets you inspect and edit those materials. </p>
<p>There are various classes of material objects. When you add a new material, first select the heading for the type of material you want to add and then click the “+” icon at the bottom of the left pane.</p>
<p>Different types of material will have different data fields available.</p>

<h2 id="internal-loads">Internal Loads</h2>
<p>The Loads tab allows you to create and edit load definitions for the internal load objects you will use in your model. Types of loads are listed in the right panels. Select the type of load you want to create and hit the plus button or drag a load definition from the library onto the drop zone in the lower right.</p>
<p>Once you add a loads definition, it will be available to use from the "My Model" tab on the right panel. On the Space Type tab you can assign loads to a space type or directly to a space in the Facility tab, except for Water Use Equipment.</p>
<p><img alt="Load Definitions" src="../../img/create_model/load_def.png" title="Load Definitions" />  </p>
<p>The types of loads that can be added in this tab follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>People</li>
<li>Lights</li>
<li>Luminaires</li>
<li>Electric Equipment</li>
<li>Gas Equipment</li>
<li>Steam Equipment</li>
<li>Other Equipment</li>
<li>Internal Mass</li>
<li>Water Use Equipment</li>
</ul>
<p>Internal mass is different from the other loads in that it does not use fuel; rather, it stores heat and then dissipates the heat over time. The inputs require a surface area 
assigned to a construction object.</p>
<p>Water Use Equipment is also unique in that it takes schedules, and is not part of a space type. Water Use Equipment is applied in the HVAC Systems Tab.</p>

<h2 id="space-types">Space Types</h2>
<p>Space types are the work horses of the resources in OpenStudio. Space types can define internal loads, schedule sets, and construction sets.</p>
<p>Space types define specific spaces or groups of specific spaces in your model. The spaces inherit all objects of the space type. If you redefine a space type, or an underlying object, it will affect all spaces using that space type.</p>
<p>The space types tab in the OpenStudio application is organized into a grid view. You can look through all your space types and edit the settings.</p>
<p><img alt="Grid 1" src="../../img/os_interface/space_type_grid1.png" title="Space Type Grid View" /></p>
<p><em>Above: The grid view provides a spreadsheet style layout.</em></p>
<p>If you select the "Loads" button in the Space Type tab, you will see a drop zone to create new loads. You can have multiple loads of the same type. </p>
<p><img alt="Grid 1" src="../../img/os_interface/space_type_grid_loads.png" title="Space Type Loads" /></p>
<p><em>Above: Hit the "Loads" button to edit and view loads by space type. Click on the name of a component and select the  "Edit" panel on the right to inspect and edit that item. You can edit the load definition in the example shown above.</em></p>
<p>The space types define loads such as lighting or electric equipment as simple area weighted power densities (e.g., W/ft2).  However, you can add loads in several possible ways.  For example, a space type could contain multiple types of lighting. You might define one lighting load for general lighting using a W/ft2 and then add another lighting load for decorative lighting using another watts per square foot. </p>

<h2 id="downloading-components-and-measures-from-the-building-component-library-bcl">Downloading Components and Measures from the Building Component Library (BCL)</h2>
<p>In the OpenStudio Application you can download items directly from the BCL by going to the "Components &amp; Measures" menu and choosing "Find Measures" or "Find Components." The your API key is available by registering on the <a href="https://bcl.nrel.gov/">BCL site</a> and copying it from your account page.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/create_model/bcl_window.png" class="img-responsive" alt="BCL Window"></p>
<p>The components are designed to provide data to the energy modeler and simplify the process of gathering inputs. </p>
<p>Measures are scripts that can quickly alter your model or create different reports for viewing and checking your results. Learn more about measures in the <a href="../../measures/AboutMeasures/">"About Measures"</a> section. Learn how to <a href="../../measures/Measure-Writing-Guide/">write your own custom measures.</a></p>

<h2 id="using-the-facility-tab-to-inspect-and-edit-your-model">Using the Facility Tab to Inspect and Edit Your Model</h2>
<p>The Facility tab serves a number of functions. First, it allows you to see a hierarchical tree of your model. This tree can be organized by building story, thermal zone, or as shown here, space type.</p>
<p>If you are viewing the tree by space type, and a space does not have a space type assigned, it would appear under Unassigned Space Type. A similar pattern is followed for Thermal Zone and Story.</p>
<p>The Facility tab is also where you can select spaces and assign a building story, thermal zone, and space type. This is also where you can add loads to a space. These loads would be on top of loads inherited from the space type.</p>
<p>You can also drill down to inspect individual surfaces or subsurfaces.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/create_model/facility_bldg.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Facility Tab Building"></p>
<p><em>Above: An annotated screenshot of the facilities tab with the building selected.</em></p>
<p>You can view the Building object. This contains top level construction, schedule, or space type assignments, and sets the rotation for the building. </p>
<p><img src="../../img/create_model/facility.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Facility Tab"></p>
<p><em>Above: An annotated screenshot of the facilities tab with space sort on.</em></p>
<p>This screenshot of the Facility tab below shows a surface selected. </p>
<p>Although you will generally work with the SketchUp Plug-in to define the building envelope, having a surface or subsurface selected in the Facility tab will allow you inspect and edit most attributes. Only the vertices are locked down.</p>
<p>Spaces and surfaces cannot be deleted or created. You need to use the SketchUp Plug-in to do that. </p>

<h2 id="thermal-zones">Thermal Zones</h2>
<p>OpenStudio's thermal zones parallels the EnergyPlus zone. A thermal zone represents an isothermal volume of air that may have only one thermostat. The OpenStudio thermal zone forms the connection point between the air conditioned space and the  HVAC equipment. Thermal zones can contain one or more spaces. An OpenStudio space contains 3 dimensional geometry and thermal loads. When OpenStudio performs an EnergyPlus simulation, the space objects associated with each thermal zone are geometrically combined, the space loads are averaged, and the ventilation rates from each space are added together.
Setting up thermal zones in the SketchUp Plug-in is shown below.</p>
<iframe width="640" height="360" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/8LTexVna_vw?rel=0&start=240&end=438&autoplay=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p><em>Above: This video shows you how to assign space types and download space types from the Building Component Library (BCL). It uses the OpenStudio SketchUp Plug-in.</em></p>
<p>A thermostat must be defined before running an EnergyPlus simulations with connected HVAC systems. Zone equipment, thermostat, and humidistat settings can be viewed and edited on this tab. Select the "Cooling Sizing Parameters" or "Heating Sizing Parameters" to edit those by thermal zone.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/create_model/heat_sizing.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Thermal Zone Sizing Parameters"></p>
<hr />
<h2 id="air-plant-and-zone-hvac-systems">Air, Plant and Zone HVAC Systems</h2>
<p>OpenStudio names HVAC systems and components to match EnergyPlus. So if you are familiar with EnergyPlus you will be able to recognize components names, like FanConstantVolumeModel.</p>
<p>The HVAC Systems tab is used to create, inspect, and edit air and plant loops. The green “+” at the top left is used to add template or empty loops, and the “x” next to it will delete them. The pull-down at the top right of the body is to select which loop to displayed.</p>
<p>Hit the green plus button to add a loop. </p>
<p><img src="../../img/create_model/add_hvac.png" class="img-responsive" alt="Add from Template"></p>
<p><em>Above: Add an HVAC system to your model.</em></p>
<p>When adding a template loop, there are four images within the icon. From left to right they represent the type of cooling, heating, fan, and terminal unit, in the template. The example below has cold and hot water, a variable speed fan, and a hot water reheat terminal unit.</p>
<p><img alt="HVAC Add" src="../../img/create_model/system_templates.png" title="System Icons" /></p>
<p>The top half of the loop is for supply-side objects, the bottom half is for demand. Thermal Zones and other objects can be dragged onto drop zones or nodes. Optionally you can select the splitter or mixer to bring up a list of Thermal Zones, checking the ones you want included in the loop.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/create_model/hvac_about.png" class="img-responsive" alt="HVAC Interface></p>

<p>Dragging a water use equipment object into the water use connection will create an instance of that definition. Much like lights, people and other loads, there is a fractional schedule to define usage patterns. </p>
<p>Optionally you can associate the equipment with a space. There is no direct energy use to the space, but heat from the equipment will be added to the space.</p>
<p>The equipment can be anything that uses water, hot or cold. The definition contains a peak flow rate and a target temperature schedule. Hot and cold water will mix to reach the target temperature at the fixture.</p>
<p>Click the water main, sewer, or makeup water to go back to the water mains editor. If you have a plant loop associated with the water use connection the “Loop” button will take you to the loop.</p>

<h2 id="lifecycle-costs">Lifecycle Costs</h2>
<p>The most basic parameters needed for a life cycle cost analysis are the analysis period length and the discount rate. A longer analysis period accumulates more energy cost savings than a shorter period; giving energy conservation measures a better pay back relative to their initial costs. A higher discount rate devalues future energy cost savings relative to money spent on capital improvements in the present; giving energy conservation measures a lower pay back relative to their initial costs. This tab allows users to set these parameters on their baseline model.</p>
<p>With measures, downloaded from BCL,  life cycle costs for different design alternatives can be calculated</p>
