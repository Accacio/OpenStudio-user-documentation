<p>The City College of New York (CCNY), founded in 1847, is a flagship college of The City University of New York (CUNY) system. CCNY is a comprehensive teaching, research, and service institution dedicated to accessibility and excellence in undergraduate and graduate education. CCNY offers a wide range of degrees related to engineering, architecture and science with focus on energy, sustainability and the environment. The Grove School of Engineering is active in Research and Training of graduate and undergraduate students. The Grove School of Engineering and The Bernard and Anne Spitzer School of Architecture offer a graduate program in "Sustainability in the Urban Environment"?. The program offers an interdisciplinary MS in Sustainability with two concentrations: an Architecture concentration suitable for students with backgrounds in architecture; and an Engineering-Science concentration appropriate for engineering or science majors. The overall aim of the program is to develop a workforce with the knowledge and skills that 21st century workplaces will increasingly demand, i.e., to enable them to be innovative and flexible contributors to sustainability solutions.</p>
<p>As New York City's only public university, CUNY has a special role to play in helping to meet the city's needs. The Building Performance Lab-CUNY, is ideally positioned and equipped to serve as a catalyst for change. Through collaborations with other parties, the BP lab works to accelerate market transformation in the buildings sector. The Lab's multi-track approach also includes stimulating applied research, promoting technology transfer, and conducting outreach to the real estate sector to raise awareness of sustainability goals and how they can be achieved. One focus of our work is greening existing commercial properties by promoting advanced building system technologies and best practices that reduce energy use and improve indoor environmental conditions and waste management practices. Greater tenant satisfaction is one result.A crucial best practice is the monitoring and verification that ensure that, once achieved, optimum building performance is maintained. Another focus of our work is long-term workforce development, which we pursue through curriculum development, internships, and other technology training.</p>
