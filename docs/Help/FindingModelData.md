# Finding Model Data
## OpenStudio Building Type Templates
## Building Component Library (BCL)
### Find Measures and Find Components

The BCL window gives you access to an online repository of building energy modeling data called the Building Component Library. Although you can access the BCL website on its own, OpenStudio has integrated access to the BCL from within the application. You can access this through the “Window” menu.The first time you /open this window you will be prompted for an API key, unless you have already used BCL functionality in the SketchUp Plug-in. [Instructions for finding your API Key](../getting_started/GettingStarted.md#connecting-with-the-building-component-library) are in the "Getting Started" section.
