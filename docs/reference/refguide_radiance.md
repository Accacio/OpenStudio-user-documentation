<h1>OpenStudio-Radiance Reference Guide</h1>
This reference guide explains how to use [Radiance](http://www.radiance-online.org/) to simulate the daylight ingress in your OpenStudio model, allowing for higher fidelity simulations of daylighting-related energy efficiency measures. Radiance is not constrained to simple geometry, and the OpenStudio model supports interior architectural detail such as [interior partition surfaces](next_steps/sketchup_plugin_interface#NewInteriorPartitionSurfaceGroup) (for representing columns, soffits, furniture, etc) and air walls (for eliminating thermal zone boundaries that are not actual architecture). This allows for a more accurate characterization of the spatial distribution of daylight in the OpenStudio model. 

For OpenStudio [v1.7.0](https://github.com/NREL/OpenStudio/releases/tag/v1.7.0), added support for window shades and wall thickness has increased the utility of the Radiance simulation option in the OpenStudio application.
