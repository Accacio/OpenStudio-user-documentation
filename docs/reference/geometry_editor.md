[FloorspaceJS](https://github.com/NREL/floorspace.js) is an open source software module that developers can leverage for geometry creation.  FloorspaceJS is meant to cover simple building geometry use cases only.  More complex building geometry is best developed in a full featured CAD tool and exported to gbXML for building energy modeling.  FloorspaceJS reads and writes a custom [floorplan.json](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NREL/floorspace.js/develop/schema/geometry_schema.json) JSON file format.  openStudio Methods are available in the OpenStudio SDK, which can translate this file format to ThreeJS JSON as well as to OSM.  Additionally, OpenStudio Methods are availabel that allow two OpenStudio Models to be merged.
