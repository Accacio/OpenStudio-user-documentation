<h1>The Building Component Library</h1>

The BCL is an online repository of components and measures that can be used in OpenStudio.  Registering on the BCL site provides you with an API key that can be used by the OpenStudio Application to access online components and measures.  BCL users who belong to a group can also upload their own content&mdash;public or private&mdash;to the BCL.  Users can either create a new group or request to join an existing one. The following tutorial provides information on common BCL tasks.

##Groups

###Creating a Group

To create a group, first login to the site and click the *My Dashboard* link at the top right of the BCL site.  Click on the *Create Content* tab, and then the *Group* button.  Fill out the form and click the *Save* button.

A note on group visibility:  if you create a private group, BCL users will not be able to see the group, or request membership.  You will have to manually add all users to the group (see [Adding a Member to a Group](#adding-a-member-to-a-group)).  Additionally, creating a public group does not restrict you to having only public content; a public group can have both public and private content.

Once you submit the form, a BCL admin will be notified and will review your group creation request.  You will receive an email when the group is approved, at which time you can upload content.


###Joining a Group

To join a public group, click the *Groups* button on the BCL homepage.  Select the group you would like to join and click the *Subscribe to Group* or *Request Group Membership* button.  Your membership will be pending until the group admin reviews and approves your request.
